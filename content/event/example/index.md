summary: Guest Lecture on Visual Perception using Deep Learning
abstract: lhe Department of Computer Science and Engineering in association with EEC-Alumni Students Chapter and CSI Chennai organized a Guest Lecture on Visual Perception with Deep Learning for the IV year (CSE students on 21.11.2022 through physical mode between 9:30 am and 1 1 .00 am. The presentation was about visual perceptual learning, acquisition of a real world representation, deep neural networks (DNNs) for visual perception. During this session, students learnt the practical approaches on the implementation of visual perceptions with Deep Learning.
